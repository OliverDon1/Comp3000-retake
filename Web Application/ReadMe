The Dr. AI M.D. web application uses advanced machine learning algorithms to provide diagnostic predictions based on user-inputted symptoms. This application features a robust backend powered by Python and Flask and a responsive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Docker facilitates the deployment and running of the application in a consistent environment. Before running the application, ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine. Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory. With Docker open and running, build and run the application using the command docker-compose up --build. This will build the Docker containers and start the application, making it accessible at http://localhost:3000. The project's directory structure includes the backend for Flask application code and machine learning model implementations, the frontend for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, and Docker configuration files. Key features include secure user authentication, an intuitive symptom input interface, diagnostic predictions, and a user dashboard for managing account information and viewing previous diagnoses. Technologies used in this project include Python, Flask, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, and Docker. For troubleshooting, ensure Docker is properly installed and running, and that ports 3000 and 5000 are not in use by other applications.
