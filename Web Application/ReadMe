The web application Dr. AI M.D. employs sophisticated machine learning algorithms to yield predictive diagnostic results based on the symptoms users enter. This application has a powerful backend that works magic using Python and Flask; its frontend, which includes the part of the application that the user interacts with, is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These components work together to bring the application to life. The way the application is served relies on a powerful tool called Docker. Though we'll touch on this tool more later, it is sufficient to say at this point that Docker serves the application in a consistent environment across different platforms (i.e., Windows, Linux, Mac). Before falling too far into Docker's realm, however, let's build a more solid understanding of the application itself.
The directory structure of the project encompasses three main components. The first is the backend—source code for a Flask application that serves both as a web application and as the API for a machine learning model, which is the second component. The model takes as input the symptoms a user is experiencing and outputs a prediction of the diagnosis. The third component is the frontend, which is where the user experiences the web application. The web app is something that the user can intuitively point and click to interact with with (or, more than likely, “to interact with”). The web app also provides a very secure way to perform user authentication.
To troubleshoot, verify that Docker is correctly installed and running and that ports 3000 and 5000 are not occupied by other applications.
